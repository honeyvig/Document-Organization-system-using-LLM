# Document-Organization-system-using-LLM
 to create a document organization system that utilizes LLM (Large Language Model) machine learning. The software should facilitate the import of documents via email and efax and effectively categorize them for easy retrieval. The ideal candidate will have experience in machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and software development. If you are passionate about building innovative solutions and have a strong background in these areas, we would love to hear from you!
====================
To create a document organization system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for categorization and easy retrieval, you can follow these steps. This system will automate the categorization of incoming documents, which can be imported via email, eFax, or other sources, and classified into categories for quick and efficient retrieval.
Key Components and Technologies:

    Document Importation:
        Email Integration: Using Python libraries like imaplib or email, you can automatically download emails and attachments.
        eFax Integration: Use a service like eFax API or Twilio to receive faxes and store them as documents.

    Text Preprocessing:
        Extract text from PDFs or images using libraries like PyPDF2, Tesseract OCR (for images), and pdfminer.six.

    Document Categorization:
        LLM Integration: Use pre-trained large language models like OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers, or a fine-tuned BERT-based model to process the document text and categorize it into predefined classes (e.g., invoices, contracts, personal documents, etc.).

    Machine Learning Model:
        Use supervised learning for classification, leveraging models like BERT, RoBERTa, or other transformer-based models. For simpler tasks, you can use traditional methods like TF-IDF with a Logistic Regression classifier.

    Database Integration:
        Store documents in a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for easy indexing and retrieval.

    User Interface:
        Build a UI (e.g., using Flask or Django for a web app) to allow users to search and retrieve categorized documents.

Python Code Outline:

import os
import imaplib
import email
import PyPDF2
import pytesseract
from email.header import decode_header
from transformers import pipeline
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Email Integration - Fetch emails and attachments
def fetch_emails_from_gmail(email_id, password):
    # Establish connection to Gmail using IMAP
    mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
    mail.login(email_id, password)
    mail.select('inbox')
    
    status, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')
    email_ids = messages[0].split()
    
    for email_id in email_ids:
        status, msg_data = mail.fetch(email_id, '(RFC822)')
        for response_part in msg_data:
            if isinstance(response_part, tuple):
                msg = email.message_from_bytes(response_part[1])
                subject, encoding = decode_header(msg["Subject"])[0]
                if isinstance(subject, bytes):
                    subject = subject.decode(encoding or 'utf-8')
                
                if msg.is_multipart():
                    for part in msg.walk():
                        content_type = part.get_content_type()
                        filename = part.get_filename()
                        if filename:  # Save the attachment
                            with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
                                f.write(part.get_payload(decode=True))
                else:
                    content_type = msg.get_content_type()
                    if content_type == 'text/plain':
                        body = msg.get_payload(decode=True).decode()
    return email_ids

# Text Extraction (from PDFs)
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page in reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

# Text Extraction (from images)
def extract_text_from_image(image_path):
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_path)
    return text

# Categorization using a pre-trained model
def categorize_document(text):
    model = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
    candidate_labels = ["invoice", "contract", "letter", "report", "personal", "receipt"]
    result = model(text, candidate_labels)
    return result['labels'][0]  # Returns the top category

# Storing Documents and Metadata
def store_document(doc_text, category):
    # Connect to MongoDB for storing the document
    client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
    db = client["document_database"]
    collection = db["documents"]
    document = {
        "text": doc_text,
        "category": category,
        "timestamp": datetime.now()
    }
    collection.insert_one(document)

# Main function
def main():
    email_id = 'youremail@gmail.com'
    password = 'yourpassword'
    emails = fetch_emails_from_gmail(email_id, password)
    
    for email_file in emails:
        # Process the attached documents (PDFs or Images)
        if email_file.endswith(".pdf"):
            doc_text = extract_text_from_pdf(email_file)
        elif email_file.endswith((".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png")):
            doc_text = extract_text_from_image(email_file)
        
        # Categorize the document
        category = categorize_document(doc_text)
        
        # Store the document and metadata
        store_document(doc_text, category)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Steps Breakdown:

    Email Import: The fetch_emails_from_gmail function fetches emails from Gmail using the IMAP protocol, retrieves the subject and attachments, and saves them locally for processing.
    Text Extraction:
        PDFs: The extract_text_from_pdf function extracts text from PDF documents using PyPDF2.
        Images: The extract_text_from_image function uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from image attachments.
    Document Categorization: The categorize_document function uses the Zero-Shot Classification model from Hugging Face to classify the document into predefined categories (e.g., invoice, contract, etc.).
    Storage: The documents are stored in a MongoDB database along with metadata like category and timestamp.

Requirements:

    Install necessary libraries:

pip install transformers pymongo PyPDF2 pytesseract pdfminer.six imaplib

Set up MongoDB locally or use a hosted service like MongoDB Atlas.
Use Tesseract OCR for image text extraction. You can install it via:

    sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

Conclusion:

This Python-based document organization system leverages NLP and machine learning to automatically categorize incoming documents. It provides efficient document retrieval based on content analysis and integrates with email and fax systems. By utilizing transformer models and OCR technology, the system can handle a wide variety of document formats and extract relevant information for easy management and retrieval.
